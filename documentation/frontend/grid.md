# Grid
> This documentation explains the working of grid component.
> See also: [buildBar](buildBar.md)

The grid is one of the core components of the game. On here, all the 3D buildings are placed. 

It is based on the popular Treejs module. 

> We chose visuals over filesize!

Meaning: Some 3D files might be a little bigger then usual pictures. However, we found a [tool](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/) which compresses 3D files (.glb) by 70%, which makes the site yet responsive enough. 

> We are (yet) no 3D Model Masters, so we credited all used entities [here](buildingList.md)

The grid can be moved & played around with. It is funny, and it allows the player to look at its town in all directions. 

To render each model correctly, we adjusted the size & some colours to look pretty in the game setting. The same tool specified above helped us, creating initial code for each model. Credits are made to the authors!
