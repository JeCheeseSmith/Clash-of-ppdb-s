# Resource bar
> This documentation explains the working of resource-bar component.

The bar in the top middle part of the screen displays the amount of resources you have with their respective icon.
Hovering over an icon will enlarge it. API calls are made to ensure that the amount displayed matches with the amount of resources your city has.

4 Resources are displayed: Wood, Stone, Steel & Food. Wood and stone are predominantly used for constructing buildings and upgrading them while iron is mainly used to recruit your troops, food is used to maintain your current amount of troops. If there is not enough food available your troops will starve and die.
