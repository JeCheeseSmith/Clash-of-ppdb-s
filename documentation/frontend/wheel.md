# wheel of fortune

WheelOfFortune is a component that uses state variables to control the visibility of the wheel and also of the popup. It renders a button to toggle the wheel menu, a spinning button to spin the wheel, the wheel with colored segments representing different prizes, and a popup displaying the won prize. When the spinning button is clicked, the wheel rotates, and after a delay, the prize popup is shown with the won prize. 


The styles of both the wheel-button, spin-button, segments of the wheel and the popup-prize are present in the wheel.css file.
