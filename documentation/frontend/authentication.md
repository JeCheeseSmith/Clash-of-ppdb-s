# Login page 

The LoginPage function, defined in 'login.jsx', is responsible for rendering the login interface.

This function has three states: username, password and errormessage. Initially, the value of each state is set to an empty string.

This component returns a JSX that contains the layout of the log-in page. The JSX uses styles from 'login_signup.css'. The background image was generated by ChatGPT.
The layout includes input elements for the username and password, which are connected to the 'handleUsernameChange' and 'handlePasswordChange' event handlers, respectively. 
These event handlers update the 'username' and 'password' state variables as the user types something in the input-box.

When you click on the sign-up button, the event handler "handleSignUpClick" is called. This event handler handles the navigation from the log-in page to the sign-up page.
When you click on the login button, the event handler "handleLoginClick" is called. This event handler checks if a user already exists by calling the API. 
If the user exists, then the settlement ID (sid), which is returned by the API, is stored and navigation to the main page is initiated. 
If the login fails, the errormessage state is updated to inform the user of incorrect credentials, displayed alongside an exclamation icon.
You can also log in by clicking on the Enter Button on your keyboard.

If the game is accessed using a computer or laptop, the login page will be displayed. Otherwise, the user will receive a message indicating that their device is not compatible.
Additionally, the appropriateness of the username is verified.


# Sign-up page

The 'RegistrationPage()' function, defined in the 'signUp.jsx' file, is the component that generates the registration interface. 

This function works similarly to the 'LoginPage()' function but is designed with different steps specifically for signing up.

The event handler "handleLoginClick" is replaced by "handleSaveClick". This event handler first makes sure that something has been entered in the input box, as the username cannot be left blank. 
Next, it checks if the username already exists by consulting the database through an API call. If the username is not taken, the new user can proceed with the registration. 
Their settlement ID (sid) will be saved, and they will be directed to the main page. If the username is already taken, an error message will appear, indicating that the user already exists.

You can sign up by clicking on the Enter Button on your keyboard or on the 'Make Account' button.

The appropriateness of the username is also verified.
