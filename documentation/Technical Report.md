This document will explain how our game works. New players are encouraged to read through this if they are not familiar with the genre of game or if they have question about certain game mechanics.
This explanation is divided into 4 parts: Account management & logging in, Social systems, City management and attack/defending.  
## Making an account | Logging in

While visiting the game site you will be prompted to sign into your account to play the game. If you already have an account you just need to fill in your username and password and click 'login'.

If you don't have an account you will have to click 'Sign Up' and choose a username and password, fill in the respective fields and then click 'Make Account'. You will now have successfully created a new account. The username and password you chose for your new account will now be your login credentials for the new account.
## Social systems

Our game has two different kinds of social functions in the form of friends and clans.

You can send friend requests to other players which when accepted will make you two friends. Friendship has benefits such being able to chat with that player.
To send a friend request press the 'social' icon and navigate to the tab 'Search person' in this tab you will be able to send friend requests.
To accept friend requests navigate to the tab friend requests instead.

Clans can be created by players in the 'create clan' tab or joined in the 'Join clan' tab.
Being in a clan with other players makes you able to chat or exchange resources with these other players. In addition players in the same clan cannot attack each other and are able to help other players of their clan. 
## City management

#### Resources

As resources are a vital part of this game managing them will be your top priority, you can see your current amount of resources in a bar in top of the screen.
There four different kinds of resources: wood, stone, iron and food. Wood and stone are predominantly used for constructing buildings and upgrading them while iron is mainly used to recruit your troops, food is used to maintain your current amount of troops. If there is not enough food available your troops will starve and die.

#### Your city

You are able to view your city in the middle of your screen. Buildings are placed on a grid and can always be moved around later.
You are able to rotate and zoom in and out on your city by scrolling with the mouse (zooming in/out) or clicking and dragging (rotating).

On the bottom of the screen there is a build menu, clicking it opens up a larger menu where you can see all kinds of buildings sorted into different tabs.
