## Design Choices Overview

- We created our own chat API's to get familiar with the web technologies
- Using TreeJS to make a wonderfull grid! (Visuals > Looks)

We didn't made a string/report visitor because of a lack of time


Our database is expandable; more soldier & function types can be added (frontend changes will always be needed: e.g. visualisation)
